== Managing a homelab

In my free time I manage a self-hosted homelab over a Raspberry Pi (RPi). To keep things relatively simple, it's a *Docker Compose* file of several services, such as the media server.
SSH'ing into the homelab is only possible via public key authentication, and a firewall (ufw) is in place to restrict access only from within my LAN.
